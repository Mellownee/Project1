- PROJECT 1 Summary

    TRMS, or Tuition Reimbursement Management System is a full-stack web application that allows employees 
    to submit requests for reimbursements for courses, events, and certifications. These requests can then 
    be approved or rejected by the employee's direct supervisor, department head, and a benefits coordinator
     while the employee is able to track the status of their requests.

1st BACKEND FOLDER  START WITH -> node index.js

    Dependecies
        npm init -y -------to initialize 
        npm install express
        npm install body-parser
        npm install pg ------to install postgres
        npm install nodemon
        npm install cors

    dbconnections.js- has the code to connect to database.


    index.js- has the GET POST PUT DELETE CODE IN IT.




        figure out how to dropdown menu for approve or deny?
        or do a boolean where null= pending checked = true unchcked = false

        write a query to make null values say pending.
        OR  write a if then statement to make null values hidden from UI.



04/09
2nd FRONTEND FOLDER TERMINAL START WITH -> npm start
    npx create-react-app frontend
    npm install axios
    npm install react-router
    npm install react-router-dom

    App.js --> has the routes

    Home.js --> is what is shown on UI

    Login.js --> works ***but the role part is not functional or defined in the backend***

    UserRegistration.js --> works but when i made the employee id unique it crashed instead
        of throwing an error.

    Requests.js --> works but comments will be blank until filled. maybe we can auto fill with *no comments*
        and a dropdown menu for status where it can be pending aproved or denied.
